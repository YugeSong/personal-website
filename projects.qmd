**Photography Data Analysis** 

A group of six UCLA undergraduate students in Digital Humanities 101 was tasked with a project of analyzing a dataset from multiple angles and presenting their research findings through an exploratory website.

Data we used: The Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) [https://github.com/cmoa/collection](https://github.com/cmoa/collection)

Website we built: [https://photostorians.humspace.ucla.edu/](https://photostorians.humspace.ucla.edu/)



**IMDB Review Sentiment Prediction**
As a team of 4 UCLA Statistics and Data Science undergrads, we analyzed the IMDB Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews and studied the relationship between the textual content of reviews and the sentiments expressed. 

Here is our [Sentiment Paper](Stats101C.pdf "Sentiment Paper"). 



**Experiment Design and Analysis** 

I led a team of 4 to design an experiment based on a simulated island to investigate the relationship between
different activities on the “inhabitants.”
I also used GPower to determine sample size and collect data from 168 samples and input the collected data and code
into R, analyzed the data result and created boxplots.
