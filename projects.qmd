## Projects

### Photography Data Analysis 

A group of six UCLA undergraduate students in Digital Humanities 101 was tasked with a project of analyzing a dataset from multiple angles and presenting their research findings through an exploratory website.

Data we used: The Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) [https://github.com/cmoa/collection](https://github.com/cmoa/collection)

Website we built: [https://photostorians.humspace.ucla.edu/](https://photostorians.humspace.ucla.edu/)



### IMDB Review Sentiment Prediction

As a team of 4 UCLA Statistics and Data Science undergrads, we analyzed the IMDB Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews and studied the relationship between the textual content of reviews and the sentiments expressed. 

Here is our [Sentiment Paper](Stats101C.pdf "Sentiment Paper"). 



### Simulated Experiment Design and Analysis

Based on a simulated island, we designed an experiment to investigate the effects of different activities on the “inhabitants.”

Here is our [Island Paper](stats100b.pdf "Island Paper")
