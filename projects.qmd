### IMDB Review Sentiment Prediction

As a team of 4 UCLA Statistics and Data Science undergraduates, we analyzed the IMDB Data set of 50,000 movie reviews and studied the relationship between the textual content of reviews and the sentiments expressed. 

Raw Data set: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15rhdfkfIeTy9yK2jL00cExFm8qX0_BUI?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15rhdfkfIeTy9yK2jL00cExFm8qX0_BUI?usp=sharing)

We concluded our findings into this [Sentiment Paper](projects/Stats101C.pdf "Sentiment Paper").

The Airbnb data set in Los Angeles covers about 45,000 observations for hosting, and we used EDA, Geospatial Analysis, and Sentiment Analysis to investigate the relationship of all predictors with price.

### Simulated Experiment Design and Analysis

Based on a simulated island, we designed an experiment to investigate the effects of different activities on the “inhabitants.”

Here is our [Island Paper](projects/stats100b.pdf "Island Paper").
