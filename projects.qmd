### IMDB Review Sentiment Prediction

As a team of 4 UCLA Statistics and Data Science undergraduates, we analyzed the IMDB Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews and studied the relationship between the textual content of reviews and the sentiments expressed. 

Here is our [Sentiment Paper](projects/Stats101C.pdf "Sentiment Paper"). 

Data sources: [IMDB Dataset](projects/IMDB Dataset.csv "IMDB Dataset"), [positive sentiment](projects/positive-words.txt "positive sentiment"), and [negative sentiment](projects/negative-words.txt "negative-words").

### Simulated Experiment Design and Analysis

Based on a simulated island, we designed an experiment to investigate the effects of different activities on the “inhabitants.”

Here is our [Island Paper](projects/stats100b.pdf "Island Paper")
