## Bio

I am a senior at UCLA, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Anthropology. Through years of study, I have refined my collaborative skills and proficiency in data analysis. Meanwhile, my background in Anthropology deepens my appreciation for diverse cultures and individuals. I pay strong attention to detail and am naturally curious and passionate about understanding how and why things work. I am now actively seeking job opportunities that provide hands-on experience in the data field.

Attached is my [cv](/docs/cv/Yuge Song Resume.pdf "cv")
which is actually a resume for now. 



I worked as Administrative Assistant I in Foothill College International Student Programs Office from 2021 to 2022. I assisted the director of International Partner Relations to prepare partnership agreements and distribute marketing material. The work involves managing data, and I have updated a total of 300+ student and agent data into the school database. As an administrative assistant, I also designed posters for recruitment purposes using Pixelmator Pro and Procreate.

I was formerly a member of Finance Board in the ASFC Campus Council during 2020 and 2021. We developed business and made partnership with the local government. Our goal was to support student activities, and we perform financial budgeting analysis bi-weekly,

#### Publication
I assisted Dr. Qi in her research on the Coupling and Coordination of Systems of Citizenization, Regional
Economy, and Public Service in China from the Perspective of Sustainable Development. The research report was
published on MDPI as an open access article.
I also helped the research team to collect a total of 150,000+ data and performed 10+ literature reviews independently, and we applied entropy method and built up a coupling coordination model to process and analyze the data set.
