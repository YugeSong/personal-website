The primary objective is to an- alyze the relationship between the textual con- tent of reviews and the sentiments expressed. Using a diverse array of models, including Lo- gistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, we aim to uncover patterns and nuances within the language of movie re- views."
